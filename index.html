        alt="Screenshot-2024-04-29-144016" border="0">The Feline Friends Association (FFA) is a charity aiming to
      fundraise and spread awareness of various feline illnesses.</p>
    <p>
      We have partnerships with various pet hospitals and feline research organizations to support the development of a
      more holistic understanding of feline diseases as well as help cover catsâ€™ healthcare expenses.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="events">
    We host both online and offline fundraising events throughout NYC and we aim to encourage people to learn more about
    the lives of cats and educate cat owners about the various dangerous feline diseases so cat owners can notice early
    signs and make informed decisions that best benefits the health of their cats. The FFA enables people to gain
    knowledge and interest in feline disease research and its importance while interacting with cats.

      <input type="checkbox" id="accordion1" class="accordion-input">
      <label for="accordion1" class="accordion-label"><li> <b>Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)</b></li></label>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>FIV severely weakens a cat's immune system, making them vulnerable to secondary infections. This disease is
          passed on from cats to cats through bite wounds, making outdoor cats who engage in fights susceptible to FIV.
          Symptoms of FIV may not be apparent at first and may even first develop years after the initial infection.
          There is no cure for FIV but infected cats can live healthy lives with proper medical interventions and it is
          important to recognize early signs of FIV.</p>
        <p>Common symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fever</li>
          <li>Recurring or chronic infections</li>
          <li>Gingivitis</li>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Feline Leukemia Virus (FELV+) is a retrovirus that causes cancer in cats. It is highly infectious and can be
          passed on from cat to cat via cats' urine, blood, saliva, or feces. The most common way of transmission is
          through infected mothers to their offspring at birth or through contact with infected cats. FELV+ can severely
          weaken a cat's immune system, causing anemia and making cats vulnerable to other diseases. Infected cats have
          to be kept separate from healthy cats. There is no cure for FELV+ but cats can live normal and prolonged lives
          with medication.</p>
        <p>Common symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>

    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>Feline diabetes is similar to diabetes in humans in which individuals are unable to produce insulin or have a proper response to insulin.

    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>Feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus are highly infectious viruses that cause upper respiratory diseases and are prevalent in multi-cat households and shelters. These viruses can be passed on from cat to cat through coughing, sneezing, and sharing of food and water bowls. Once infected, a cat becomes a carrier for life and is capable of infecting other cats even though no symptoms are shown. Infected cats are also susceptible to secondary infections.</p>
      <p>Common symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sneezing</li>
        <li>Fever</li>

    <label for="accordion7" class="accordion-label"><li> <b>Hyperthyroidism</b></li></label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>Hyperthyroidism is caused by an increased production of thyroid hormones from an enlarged thyroid gland on a cat's neck. Hyperthyroidism typically affects middle-aged or older cats. Specific causes of hyperthyroidism are unclear but environmental factors and high dietary iodine composition are hypothesized to be causative factors. Oral medication intervention can effectively lower thyroid levels and enable cats to live a normal life.</p>
      <p>Common symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
